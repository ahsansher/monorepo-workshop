## 00. Monorepos and Forests ðŸŒ³

I've found a compelling metaphor for understanding Monorepos - the forest itself!

- **Monorepos, like forests, thrive on interconnectedness**. Trees in a forest are connected with "wood-wide web" of fungal filaments. In a monorepo multiple projects coexist within a single monorepo, promoting efficient resource sharing and management.
- **Monorepos simplify dependency management.** All projects share the same dependencies, much like trees in a forest sharing water and nutrients through their interconnected network.
- **The resilience of a monorepo mirrors that of a forest.** The failure of one project doesn't mean disaster for the entire system, just as older "mother trees" nurture younger ones, ensuring the forest's survival and sustainability.

Join me as we traverse the forest of monorepos, discovering its interconnected pathways and hidden treasures!
