## 03. Sharing Code Across Projects in a Monorepo

Task: Run code from one package inside another package. Make each project into an ESM project. Install package number 2 into package 1. Run `pnpm install` and take a look at files in the node_modules folder.

Note: ESM stands for ECMAScript Modules. It's a standard for working with modules in JavaScript. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program. ESM is the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of import and export statements.

This is the core of working in a monorepo!

<summary>ðŸ’ª Challenge</summary>

Your task is to:

1. Convert each project into an ESM (ECMAScript Modules) module.
2. Install the `firelane-two` package into the `firelane-one` package using `pnpm install`. You should be able to use `firelane-two` inside the same `index.js` file. You will need to adjust the code to be exported from `firelane-two`.
3. Explore the `node_modules` created at the root directory and in `package one`.
