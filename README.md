# monorepo-workshop üå≥

Welcome to the Monorepo Workshop! This workshop is your guide to understanding and implementing monorepos at any scale.

We'll explore the advantages of using a monorepo structure, such as improved code sharing, simplified dependency management, and increased codebase resilience. You'll learn how to use pnpm, an efficient package manager, and Turborepo, a tool that helps manage monorepos, optimize build systems, and enhance CI/CD processes.

Join us as we navigate the world of monorepos, making your development process more streamlined and efficient.

## Exercise-Driven Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you learn by doing. It's structured around a series of exercises that will challenge you to engage deeply with the concepts. Here's how it works:

1. **Introduction ‚õ∫**: Each lesson begins with an introduction that sets the context. This will give you a clear understanding of what you'll be learning and why it's important.

2. **Exercise and Attempt üèîÔ∏è**: After the introduction, you'll be presented with one or more exercises. These are practical tasks that you need to attempt to solve to the best of your ability. Remember, learning is a process and it's okay to struggle a bit. You might even need to do some Googling, and that's perfectly fine!

3. **Solution üö©**: After you've attempted the exercises, I'll walk you through the solutions. This step-by-step walkthrough will help you understand the correct approach and the reasoning behind it.

4. **Elaboration and Feedback ‚úçÔ∏è**: After each exercise, you'll find an Elaboration and Feedback link. It's crucial to fill this out, focusing particularly on the elaboration part. Here, you'll write down the core concepts you've learned from the exercise. This practice reinforces your new knowledge and helps you remember it more effectively.

By following these steps, you'll gain a deep and practical understanding of the topics covered in this workshop.
