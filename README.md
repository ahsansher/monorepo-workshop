# monorepo-workshop ðŸŒ³

Welcome to the Monorepo Workshop! This workshop is your guide to understanding and implementing monorepos.

We'll explore the advantages of using a monorepo structure, such as improved code sharing, simplified dependency management, and increased codebase resilience. You'll learn how to use pnpm, an efficient package manager, and Turborepo, a tool that helps manage monorepos, optimize build systems, and enhance CI/CD processes.

Join us as we navigate the world of monorepos, making your development process more streamlined and efficient.
