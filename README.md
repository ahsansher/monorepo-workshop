# Advanced Monorepo Techniques üå≥

[Teacher's Notes](https://github.com/laurosilvacom/monorepo-workshop/blob/main/notes/teacher-notes.mdx)

Welcome! This workshop is designed to navigate you through the complexities of setting up and managing monorepos within the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem.

In this workshop, we'll delve into the benefits of a monorepo structure, including efficient code sharing, streamlined dependency management, and robust codebase resilience. We'll also introduce you to pnpm, a high-performance package manager, and Turborepo, a powerful tool for managing monorepos, optimizing build systems, and enhancing CI/CD workflows.

Embark on this journey with us as we traverse the world of monorepos, aiming to make your development process more efficient and effective.

## System Requirements

- git version `2.39.0` or later
- Node.js version `21.7.1` or later
- pnpm version `9.0.6` or later

## Setup

1. **Clone the Workshop Repository**: Clone the workshop repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this by running `git clone https://github.com/laurosilvacom/monorepo-workshop` in your terminal.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Check Your Setup**: Run a test command (like `pnpm test`) to ensure everything is set up correctly. If the command runs without errors, you're good to go!

## Exercise-Driven Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you learn by doing. It's structured around a series of exercises that will challenge you to engage deeply with the concepts. Here's how it works:

1. **Introduction ‚õ∫**: Each lesson begins with an introduction that sets the context. This will give you a clear understanding of what you'll be learning and why it's important.

2. **Exercise and Attempt üèîÔ∏è**: After the introduction, you'll encounter one or more exercises. These are designed not necessarily for you to complete, but to spark your curiosity and formulate the right questions to ask me as I walk through the material. It's perfectly fine to struggle a bit or even do some Googling.

3. **Solution üö©**: After you've attempted the exercises, I'll walk you through the solutions. This step-by-step walkthrough will help you understand the correct approach and the reasoning behind it.

4. **Elaboration and Feedback ‚úçÔ∏è**: After each exercise, you'll find an Elaboration and Feedback link. It's crucial to fill this out, focusing particularly on the elaboration part. Here, you'll write down the core concepts you've learned from the exercise. This practice reinforces your new knowledge and helps you remember it more effectively.

By following these steps, you'll gain a deep and practical understanding of the topics covered in this workshop.
