# Setting Up a Monorepo with PNPM Workspaces

Package managers like npm, pnpm, and yarn all have a feature known as "workspaces". This concept allows you to have multiple packages within the same workspace, and you can link them together locally.

This means you can have an application, a library, or even multiple libraries, and you can use them locally and reference them without having to go through a publishing step such as an npm registry. This is exactly what you need if you want to set up a monorepo.

## Monorepo Workspaces

Monorepo workspaces often come in two different structures: app-centric and package-centric.

1. App-centric setup: This structure usually has a folder named "apps" at the top level, followed by "packages". This is the structure we will be using today.

2. Package-centric setup: This structure is often used by open-source frameworks like Vue.js, React.js, or Angular. It usually has a folder named "packages" where all the various packages live.

Next, we'll define the structure of our workspace in this file.

## Steps

1. Make sure you have pnpm installed: https://pnpm.io/installation

2. Create an empty folder `mkdir monorepo-playground`

3. Create a pnpm workspace https://pnpm.io/workspaces

4. Create a package.json file with `pnpm init`

```package.json
{
  "name": "monorepo-playground",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This is the package.json for our root-level tooling that we will need in our monorepo set up.

5. Structure your monorepo workspace with an app-centric setup.

```bash
mkdir apps
mkdir packages
```

6. Create an pnpm workspace for our application

In order to inform PNPM that we're setting up a workspace and not just using it for package installation, we need to create a pnpm-workspace.yaml file. This file is created at the root of the workspace and defines its structure.

```bash
touch pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

Note: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines the root of the workspace and enables you to include / exclude directories from the workspace. By default, all packages of all subdirectories are included.

```yaml
packages:
  # all packages in direct subdirs of packages/
  - 'packages/*'
  # all packages in subdirs of components/
  - 'components/**'
  # exclude packages that are inside test directories
  - '!**/test/**'
```

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

7. Add add Next.js application to a pnpm Workspace Monorepo

```bash
pnpx create-next-app@latest
```

Default options is fine!

```bash
‚úî What is your project named? ‚Ä¶ website
‚úî Would you like to use TypeScript? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use ESLint? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use `src/` directory? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
```

> Execute binaries from npm packages using `pnpx` -> https://fig.io/manual/pnpx

8. Run the scripts from `apps/website/package.json` within the workspace.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
},
```

9. Run App Scripts From the Workspace Root

pnpm's `--filter` flag allows you to restrict commands to specific subsets of packages https://pnpm.io/filtering

Ensure that each of your app's have name set in their package.json file.

```bash
pnpm --filter website dev

```

10. Create private libraries in your monorepo

Now create private libraries in your monorepo that you can share between your other packages and applications.

```packages/shared-ui/package.json
{
  "private": "true",
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Shared UI package for our monorepo playground",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {},
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Use pnpm filter commands to add external libraries to your package.

```bash
pnpm add --filter shared-ui react
pnpm add --filter shared-ui -D typescript

```

Create an entry point and set the main field in your package.json to where your code will compile when built.

```packages/shared-ui/button.tsx
'use client'

export const Button = ({}) => {
  return <button onClick={() => alert(`Hello from your app!`)}>Click me üèîÔ∏è</button>
}

```

```packages/shared-ui/index.tsx
export * from './button'
```

```packages/shared-ui/tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}

```

```packages/shared-ui/.eslintrc
{
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 6,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "es6": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off"
  }
}
```

Make sure that the build command is working: `pnpm --filter shared-ui build`. You should see the output in the `packages/shared-ui/dist`.

11. Use the private libraries in your monorepo

Adding your local packages as dependencies in a pnpm worksapce mostly works the same way as adding external packages.

```bash
pnpm add shared-ui --filter website --workspace
```

- `pnpm`: This is the package manager you're using.
- `add`: This is the command to add a new package to your project.
- `shared-ui`: This is the name of the package you're adding. In this case, it's a local workspace package.
- `--filter website`: This option tells pnpm to only operate on the 'website' package. So, it will only add the
- `shared-ui` package to the 'website' package, not to any other packages in your workspace.
- `--workspace`: This option tells pnpm to look for packages in the local workspace. So, it will find t
