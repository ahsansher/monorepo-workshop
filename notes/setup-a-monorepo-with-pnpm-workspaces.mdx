# Setting Up a Monorepo with PNPM Workspaces

Package managers like npm, pnpm, and yarn all have a feature known as "workspaces". This concept allows you to have multiple packages within the same workspace, and you can link them together locally.

This means you can have an application, a library, or even multiple libraries, and you can use them locally and reference them without having to go through a publishing step such as an npm registry. This is exactly what you need if you want to set up a monorepo.

Today, we're going to focus on setting up a workspace with pnpm.

First, let's start by creating a folder. We'll call it `pnpm`.

```bash
mkdir pnpm
```

## Monorepo Workspaces

Monorepo workspaces often come in two different structures: app-centric and package-centric.

1. App-centric setup: This structure usually has a folder named "apps" at the top level, followed by "packages". This is the structure we will be using today.

2. Package-centric setup: This structure is often used by open-source frameworks like Vue.js, React.js, or Angular. It usually has a folder named "packages" where all the various packages live.

You can use either structure or even mix them according to your project's needs.

Let's go ahead and structure our monorepo workspace with an app-centric setup.

```bash
mkdir apps
mkdir packages
```

In order to inform PNPM that we're setting up a workspace and not just using it for package installation, we need to create a pnpm-workspace.yaml file. This file is created at the root of the workspace and defines its structure.

```bash
touch pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

Next, we'll define the structure of our workspace in this file.
