# Setting Up a Monorepo with PNPM Workspaces

Package managers like npm, pnpm, and yarn all have a feature known as "workspaces". This concept allows you to have multiple packages within the same workspace, and you can link them together locally.

This means you can have an application, a library, or even multiple libraries, and you can use them locally and reference them without having to go through a publishing step such as an npm registry. This is exactly what you need if you want to set up a monorepo.

Today, we're going to focus on setting up a workspace with pnpm.
