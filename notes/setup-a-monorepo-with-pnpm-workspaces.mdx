## 1. Setting Up a Monorepo with PNPM Workspaces

Make sure you have pnpm installed: https://pnpm.io/installation

Package managers like npm, pnpm, and yarn all have a feature known as "workspaces". This concept allows you to have multiple packages within the same workspace, and you can link them together locally.

This means you can have an application, a library, or even multiple libraries, and you can use them locally and reference them without having to go through a publishing step such as an npm registry. This is exactly what you need if you want to set up a monorepo.

## 2. Create an empty folder `mkdir monorepo-playground`

## 3. Create a pnpm workspace https://pnpm.io/workspaces

Monorepo workspaces often come in two different structures: app-centric and package-centric.

1. App-centric setup: This structure usually has a folder named "apps" at the top level, followed by "packages". This is the structure we will be using today.

2. Package-centric setup: This structure is often used by open-source frameworks like Vue.js, React.js, or Angular. It usually has a folder named "packages" where all the various packages live.

## 4. Create a package.json file with `pnpm init`

```package.json
{
  "name": "monorepo-playground",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This is the package.json for our root-level tooling that we will need in our monorepo set up.

## 5. Structure your monorepo workspace with an app-centric setup.

```bash
mkdir apps
mkdir packages
```

## 6. Create an pnpm workspace for our application

In order to inform PNPM that we're setting up a workspace and not just using it for package installation, we need to create a pnpm-workspace.yaml file. This file is created at the root of the workspace and defines its structure.

```bash
touch pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

Note: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines the root of the workspace and enables you to include / exclude directories from the workspace. By default, all packages of all subdirectories are included.

```yaml
packages:
  # all packages in direct subdirs of packages/
  - 'packages/*'
  # all packages in subdirs of components/
  - 'components/**'
  # exclude packages that are inside test directories
  - '!**/test/**'
```

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

## 7. Add add Next.js application to a pnpm Workspace Monorepo

```bash
pnpx create-next-app@latest
```

Default options is fine!

```bash
‚úî What is your project named? ‚Ä¶ website
‚úî Would you like to use TypeScript? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use ESLint? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use `src/` directory? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
‚úî Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? ‚Ä¶ No / Yes
```

> Execute binaries from npm packages using `pnpx` -> https://fig.io/manual/pnpx

8. Run the scripts from `apps/website/package.json` within the workspace.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
},
```

## 9. Run App Scripts From the Workspace Root

pnpm's `--filter` flag allows you to restrict commands to specific subsets of packages https://pnpm.io/filtering

Ensure that each of your app's have name set in their package.json file.

```bash
pnpm --filter website dev

```

## 10. Create private libraries in your monorepo

Now create private libraries in your monorepo that you can share between your other packages and applications.

```packages/shared-ui/package.json
{
  "private": "true",
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Shared UI package for our monorepo playground",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {},
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Use pnpm filter commands to add external libraries to your package.

```bash
pnpm add --filter shared-ui react
pnpm add --filter shared-ui -D typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

```

Create an entry point and set the main field in your package.json to where your code will compile when built.

```packages/shared-ui/button.tsx
export const Button = ({onClick, children}) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
}

```

```packages/shared-ui/index.tsx
export * from './button'
```

```packages/shared-ui/tsconfig.json
{
  "private": "true",
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Shared UI package for our monorepo playground",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf dist && tsc"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^7.5.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^7.5.0",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

```packages/shared-ui/.eslintrc
{
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 6,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "es6": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off"
  }
}

```

Make sure that the build command is working: `pnpm --filter shared-ui build`. You should see the output in the `packages/shared-ui/dist`.

## 11. Use the private libraries in your monorepo

Adding your local packages as dependencies in a pnpm worksapce mostly works the same way as adding external packages.

```bash
pnpm add shared-ui --filter website --workspace
```

- `pnpm`: This is the package manager you're using.
- `add`: This is the command to add a new package to your project.
- `shared-ui`: This is the name of the package you're adding. In this case, it's a local workspace package.
- `--filter website`: This option tells pnpm to only operate on the 'website' package. So, it will only add the
- `shared-ui` package to the 'website' package, not to any other packages in your workspace.
- `--workspace`: This option tells pnpm to look for packages in the local workspace. So, it will find t

Use the `shared-ui` component.

```apps/website/src/app/page.tsx
'use client'

import {Button} from 'shared-ui'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click me üèîÔ∏è</Button>
    </main>
  )
}

```

Build the shared-ui package and start your Next.js application.

```bash
pnpm --filter shared-ui build
pnpm --filter website dev
```

1. `pnpm --filter shared-ui build`: This command is building the shared-ui package. The --filter flag is used to specify which package(s) the command should be run on. In this case, it's building the shared-ui package.

2. `pnpm --filter website dev`: This command is starting the development server for the website application. Again, the --filter flag is used to specify that the command should be run on the website package. The dev command is typically used to start a development server, which often includes features like hot-reloading.

3. Recursively run a script in all projects

ometimes you might want to run commands across all the applications and target, let's say, all the build commands and build all the apps and libraries there. To do that, we can use the -r commands, which recursively runs a given command.

https://pnpm.io/cli/run

```bash
pnpm run -r build
```

## 12. Add a second application

It is also important to note that the only package-lock.json file that should exist, exists at the root of the project.
