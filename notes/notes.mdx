# Creating a Monorepo

We are going to focus on a barebones setup. We are not going to introduce any compilers, so that we can get the fundamentals down. Then, we can apply these to any project, whether that's a React, Svelte, or Vue framework.

Task: Create package.json files and folders following the monorepo structure. Create a pnpm-workspace.yaml outlining where pnpm will look for submodules of our monorepo.

Task: Update the package or submodule package.json. Create a script to run a JavaScript file. Run the script at the root of the project.
